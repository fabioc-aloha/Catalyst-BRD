# Microsoft Technical Documentation Standards

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Enhanced technical documentation standards for Microsoft internal transformation projects, Azure implementations, and enterprise solution documentation.

## ðŸ“‹ Activation Pattern
**File Patterns**: `*technical*`, `*implementation*`, `*deployment*`, `*architecture*`

## ðŸ“Š Microsoft Technical Documentation Framework

### Core Documentation Standards

- **System Architecture**: Comprehensive system design with component relationships
- **Integration Patterns**: API specifications, data flows, and system interfaces
- **Performance Requirements**: Scalability, throughput, and response time specifications
- **Security Architecture**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection frameworks

#### 2. Implementation Documentation
- **Deployment Procedures**: Step-by-step implementation guidance
- **Configuration Management**: Environment setup and configuration parameters
- **Testing Strategies**: Unit, integration, and performance testing frameworks
- **Rollback Procedures**: Risk mitigation and recovery strategies

#### 3. Azure Enterprise Integration
- **Azure Services Mapping**: Recommended Azure services for each component
- **Cloud Architecture Patterns**: Best practices for Azure enterprise implementations
- **Scalability Design**: Auto-scaling and performance optimization strategies
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource management and cost control frameworks
