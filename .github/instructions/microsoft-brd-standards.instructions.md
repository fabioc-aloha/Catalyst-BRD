# Enhanced BRD Standards Procedural Memory

## Enhanced BRD Document Structure with Next Actions Framework

### Core Document Components with Action Integration
- **Document Information** with author assignment and review scheduling next actions
- **Quick Reference** with project summary requiring stakeholder confirmation next actions
- **Business Context & Objectives** with 1-2 paragraph introductions explaining purpose and framework
- **Stakeholder Matrix** with comprehensive role definitions requiring team assignment next actions
- **Requirements Sections** with detailed specifications and technical validation next actions
- **Project Timeline & Milestones** requiring realistic date confirmation next actions
- **Risk Management** with probability/impact assessment requiring workshop next actions
- **Success Metrics & KPIs** requiring baseline establishment next actions
- **Business Process Documentation** requiring current/future state mapping next actions
- **Requirements Traceability** requiring detailed specification collaboration next actions
- **RACI Matrix** (Appendix A) with comprehensive responsibility mapping across all activities
- **Meeting Questions** (Appendix B) with stakeholder-specific targeted questions and consolidated next actions

### Section Introduction Pattern (MANDATORY)
Every major section MUST include 1-2 introductory paragraphs that:
- Explain the section's purpose and business importance
- Provide context for how it relates to overall project success
- Guide stakeholders on how to use the information effectively

```
**游꿢 Next Required Action**: [Specific action] with [Primary Owner] to [Expected Outcome] (See Appendix B: [Reference to specific questions])
```

## Enhanced Table-Enhanced Formatting Standards

### Primary Table Types with Enhanced Columns
- **Project Summary Tables**: Aspect/Details format with next action references
- **Stakeholder Matrix Tables**: Role/Name/Responsibilities/Authority/Frequency/Status format
- **Requirements Tables**: ID/Requirement/Priority/Source/Status/Next Action format
- **Timeline Tables**: Phase/Deliverable/Dates/Owner/Status/Dependencies format
- **Risk Register Tables**: Risk/Description/Probability/Impact/Level/Mitigation/Owner/Status format
- **RACI Matrix Tables**: Activity mapped to all stakeholder roles with R/A/C/I assignments

### Table Enhancement Rules (MANDATORY)
- Use tables for ALL structured information (avoid paragraph lists)
- Include status/priority columns for tracking progress
- Add "Next Required Action" references linking to specific appendix questions
- Maintain consistent column formatting across similar table types
- Use priority indicators (游댮 Critical, 游리 High, 游릭 Medium) for visual clarity
- Include dependency tracking in timeline and milestone tables

## RACI Matrix Appendix Standards (Appendix A)

### RACI Matrix Structure Requirements
- **RACI Legend**: Clear definition of R/A/C/I responsibilities with examples
- **Project Activities RACI**: Governance, budget, timeline, resource allocation
- **Technical Development RACI**: System design, development, testing, deployment
- **Data & Reporting RACI**: Integration, validation, reporting setup, analytics
- **Compliance & Security RACI**: Privacy review, data protection, audit compliance
- **Change Management RACI**: Training, adoption, communication, support
- **Operations & Maintenance RACI**: Production support, monitoring, optimization
- **RACI Summary by Role**: Primary responsibilities and key accountabilities matrix

### RACI Matrix Coverage Requirements (MANDATORY)
- Map ALL stakeholder roles across ALL project activities
- Ensure single Accountable (A) person per activity
- Distribute Responsible (R) assignments based on expertise

## Meeting Questions Appendix Standards (Appendix B)

### Meeting Questions Structure Requirements
- **Meeting Structure Recommendations**: Duration/Participants/Objectives/Preparation table
- **Stakeholder-Specific Question Sets**: Organized by role with purpose and expected output
- **Enhanced Question Tables**: Include "BRD Section Reference" column linking questions to specific document sections
- **Consolidated Next Required Actions**: Map all section next actions to meetings, owners, and timelines
- **Priority Action Items**: 游댮 Critical, 游리 High, 游릭 Medium priority matrix for immediate focus
- **Meeting Preparation Checklist**: Before/During/After meeting procedures and deliverables

### Question Enhancement Requirements (MANDATORY)
- Target ALL placeholders and missing information in main document
- Organize questions by stakeholder role for efficient meeting planning
