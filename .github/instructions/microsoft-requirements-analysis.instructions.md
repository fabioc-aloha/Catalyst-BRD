# Microsoft Requirements Analysis Procedural Memory

## Requirements Elicitation Framework
### Stakeholder-Driven Requirements Gathering
- Implement structured interview processes with Microsoft internal stakeholders
- Design comprehensive stakeholder matrix with authority levels and decision-making power
- Configure systematic requirements validation with business subject matter experts
- Create requirements traceability matrix linking business needs to technical solutions
- Establish clear acceptance criteria for all functional and non-functional requirements

### Business Process Analysis
- Document current state processes and identify inefficiencies and pain points
- Design future state processes incorporating Microsoft enterprise best practices
- Create detailed process flow diagrams using Microsoft Visio or Lucidchart
- Identify automation opportunities using Microsoft Power Platform
- Document change impact analysis for stakeholder communication

## Requirements Validation and Management
### Quality Assurance Framework
- Implement SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) criteria
- Configure requirements peer review process with technical and business validation
- Establish requirements baseline and change control procedures
- Create comprehensive test cases linked to requirements for validation
- Design requirements coverage analysis for project completeness

### Microsoft Enterprise Integration
- Align requirements with Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework principles
- Integrate with Azure Architecture Center best practices and patterns
- Consider Microsoft 365 collaboration and productivity requirements
- Include Power Platform automation and workflow opportunities
- Align with Microsoft security and compliance frameworks

## Non-Functional Requirements Specification
### Performance and Scalability Requirements
- Define specific performance metrics (response time, throughput, concurrent users)
- Specify scalability requirements for user growth and data volume expansion
- Include disaster recovery and business continuity requirements
- Document availability and uptime requirements (SLA definitions)
- Define capacity planning and resource allocation requirements

### Security and Compliance Requirements
- Implement Microsoft Entra ID authentication and authorization requirements
- Define data protection and privacy requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX compliance)
- Specify audit logging and monitoring requirements
- Include penetration testing and security assessment requirements
- Document role-based access control (RBAC) and privilege management

## Requirements Documentation Standards
### Structured Documentation Framework
- Use consistent requirement identification numbering (REQ-001, REQ-002, etc.)
- Include requirement priority classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Document requirement source (stakeholder, regulation, business process)
- Include acceptance criteria and validation methods for each requirement
- Maintain requirement status tracking (Draft, Approved, Implemented, Tested)

### Cross-Reference and Traceability
- Link requirements to business objectives and success criteria
- Map requirements to technical architecture components and services
- Create bidirectional traceability between requirements and test cases
- Include impact analysis for requirement changes and modifications
- Maintain version control and change history for all requirements
