# Microsoft BRD Creation Episode Template

## Phase 1: Project Discovery and Requirements Gathering
### Stakeholder Identification and Analysis
- Identify all stakeholders across business, technical, and operational domains
- Map stakeholder authority levels, decision-making power, and influence
- Document communication preferences and meeting availability
- Create comprehensive stakeholder matrix with roles, responsibilities, and contact information
- Establish stakeholder engagement strategy and communication plan

### Business Context and Objectives Definition
- Document current business state and challenges requiring solution
- Define clear business objectives and success criteria
- Identify key business drivers and constraints
- Map business processes and workflow dependencies
- Document regulatory and compliance requirements

### Initial Requirements Elicitation
- Conduct stakeholder interviews using structured question frameworks
- Facilitate requirements gathering workshops and brainstorming sessions
- Document functional and non-functional requirements
- Identify integration requirements and external dependencies
- Capture assumptions, constraints, and business rules

## Phase 2: Detailed BRD Development
### Document Structure Creation
- Create comprehensive document outline following Microsoft BRD standards
- Implement mandatory section introduction patterns for context and guidance
- Design table-enhanced formatting for all structured information
- Establish consistent formatting and visual hierarchy
- Create placeholder sections for all required components

### Requirements Documentation and Analysis
- Document detailed functional requirements with acceptance criteria
- Specify non-functional requirements including performance, security, and usability
- Create requirements traceability matrix linking business needs to technical solutions
- Document business rules and validation requirements
- Identify and document interface requirements and data flows

### Business Process Documentation
- Map current state business processes and identify pain points
- Design future state processes incorporating proposed solution
- Document process improvements and efficiency gains
- Create process flow diagrams and workflow documentation
- Identify change management requirements and impact analysis

## Phase 3: Technical Architecture and Planning
### Solution Architecture Design
- Design high-level technical architecture aligned with Microsoft Azure best practices
- Document integration requirements and API specifications
- Create data architecture and database design specifications
- Design security architecture including authentication and authorization
- Document deployment architecture and infrastructure requirements

### Project Planning and Timeline Development
- Create detailed project timeline with phases, milestones, and deliverables
- Identify critical path activities and potential bottlenecks
- Document resource requirements and allocation strategy
- Create risk register with probability, impact assessment, and mitigation strategies
- Establish quality assurance and testing strategy

### Cost-Benefit Analysis and ROI
- Document solution costs including development, implementation, and operational expenses
- Quantify business benefits including cost savings and efficiency improvements
- Calculate return on investment (ROI) and payback period
- Document total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis
- Create business case justification and financial projections

## Phase 4: RACI Matrix and Governance Framework (Appendix A)
### Comprehensive RACI Matrix Development
- Map all stakeholder roles across complete project lifecycle
- Document governance activities including budget approval and timeline management
- Define technical development responsibilities for design, development, and testing
- Specify data and reporting responsibilities for integration and analytics
- Document compliance and security responsibilities for audit and risk management
- Define change management and training responsibilities

### RACI Validation and Approval
- Review RACI assignments with all stakeholders for accuracy and completeness
- Ensure single point of accountability for each activity
- Validate authority levels and decision-making rights
- Document escalation procedures and conflict resolution processes
- Obtain stakeholder sign-off on RACI matrix assignments

## Phase 5: Meeting Questions and Next Actions Framework (Appendix B)
### Stakeholder-Specific Question Development
- Create targeted question sets for each stakeholder role and responsibility area
- Link questions to specific BRD sections requiring clarification or validation
- Document expected outcomes and deliverables for each question set
- Create meeting structure recommendations with duration and participant guidelines
- Develop meeting preparation checklists and follow-up procedures

### Consolidated Next Actions Planning
- Map all section next actions to specific meetings and stakeholder discussions
- Assign primary owners and target completion dates for each action item
- Create priority matrix with Critical, High, and Medium priority classifications
- Document dependencies between action items and milestone impacts
- Establish tracking mechanisms and progress reporting procedures

### Implementation Readiness Validation
- Validate completeness of all BRD sections and appendices
- Confirm stakeholder availability and commitment for next actions
- Verify technical feasibility and resource availability
- Ensure regulatory and compliance requirements are addressed
- Obtain final stakeholder approval and sign-off for BRD implementation

Focus on comprehensive requirements coverage while maintaining clear stakeholder accountability and actionable next steps
