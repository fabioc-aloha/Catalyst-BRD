## 🎯 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Requirements Quality Issues
- ❌ **Vague Language** - Avoid "user-friendly", "fast", "scalable" without quantification
- ❌ **Missing Acceptance Criteria** - Every requirement needs testable success criteria
- ❌ **Scope Creep** - Don't let requirements expand without formal change control
- ❌ **Stakeholder Assumption** - Always validate assumptions with stakeholders
- ❌ **Technical Solution Bias** - Focus on WHAT, not HOW (requirements vs. design)

### Process Problems
- ❌ **Insufficient Stakeholder Engagement** - Missing key voices leads to rework
- ❌ **Poor Change Management** - Not addressing organizational change needs
- ❌ **Inadequate Risk Assessment** - Overlooking technical or business risks
- ❌ **Missing Traceability** - Can't link requirements back to business value
- ❌ **No Implementation Planning** - BRD exists in isolation from execution
